				"description": " <br> <br> <b> AMPALAYA Bitter Gourd</b> o <b>(Momordica Charantia L.)</b> belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is also known as paria (ilocano, Indonesia), palia (Bisaya), peria (Malaysia), and Blasam pear (English). It is high in vitamins and an excellent source of iron and calcium. Fruits, young shoots and flowers are used as vegetables. It is also known to cure diabetes, arthritis, rheumatism, asthma, warts, abscesses and ulcers.<br><br><b>Guidlines:</b><br> <br><b>Climatic and Soil Requirements</b><br> Ampalaya  grows best in low elevation areas anytime of the year. It can also be grown in mid elevation. Ampalaya grows well in any type of soil with a pH of 5.5-6.5. Production is best, however, in sandy loam soil. <br> <br> <b>Land Preparation</b> <br> Prepare the soil thoroughly by plowing and harrowing twice. Make furrows 3m apart. Apply 5t/ha well-decomposed animal manure two weeks before planting.<br> <br> <b>Planting</b> <br> Ampalaya can be direct seeded or transplanted. A 1-ha production area requires 2-3kg seeds. Crack seed coat to facilitate water absorption. Soak seeds in water overnight or wrap in cheesecloth. Transplant the following day or at radicle break. Spacing is 3 m between rows and 30cm between hills. If pre-germinated or transplanted, use only one seed per hill. <br><br><b>Fertilization</b><br>At planting, apply complete fertilizer (14-14-14) at the rate of 15-20g/hill. During the dry season, side-dress 10-20g/hill urea (46-0-0) and muriate potash (0-0-60) once a month. However, during wet season, side-dress 5-10 g/hill urea and muriate of potash every two weeks. <br><br><b>Trellising, Vine Training and Pruning</b><br> Ampalaya grows with overhead trellis. Use bamboo or ipil-ipil posts at 3m x 3m spacing. Construct vertical trellis (along the row) and overhead trellis with a combination of GI wire and abaca twine or nylon string. Spacing of 1.5 between rows and 0.75 cm between hills may also be used. <br><br>Train the vines on the vertical trellis. Lateral shoots may be pruned, leaving only the main vine. Remove all female flowers below the overhead trellis. Allow branching and fruiting on the overhead trellis. Fruits may also be allowed to form just above the 10th node.<br><br><b>Harvesting</b><br> Harvest when the fruits are green, shiny and have attained full size. This is about 15-20 days from pollination or 60-95 days from planting. Priming can be done at 2-3 days interval. Harvesting can be done continuously for 2-3 months.",

				"description": "<br><br><b> Mango</b> is an evergreen, erect, and branched tree. 10-45 m tall. The trunk is 60-120 cm in diameter. It has a long taproot and dense surface mass of feeding roots. The bark is grayish brown and cracked. The leaves are simple, spirally arranged, and produced in flushes.  Young leaves are usually yellowish or reddish but eventually turns dark, shiney green. The flower are greenish yellow. The fleshy fruit is very variable in shape, size and color. It is, however, usually oval or oblong, and yellowish green to reddish in color. The flesh is either fibrous or nonfibrous. The peel is fairly thick. <br><br><b>Variety</b><br> In the Philippines, the popular mango varieties are ‘Carabao’ and ‘Pico’. <br><br><b>Uses</b><br>The mango is cultivated for its fruit which can be eaten in three distinct ways, depending on the cultivar: ripe, and processed. Processing may be done at various stages of fruit maturity. It may be in the form of pickles, dried slices in syrup, juice, puree, or paste, etc. the green fruit is also flavor fish and meat dishes. The seed kernels serve as feed to cattle and poultry. They are even used as famine food in India. The young leaves are cooked as vegetables or even eaten fresh. The dried flower and bark and decoction of the kernels serve as astringents in traditional medicine. Extracts of unripe fruits, barks, stem, or leaves have shown antibiotic activity. The wood is fairly strong, hard, and easy to work. So, it can be employed for construction and outdoor applications. It must, however, be treated first with preservative. The wood also makes excellent charcoal and is used in mushroom culture.<br><br><b>Soil and Climatic Requirements</b><br> Mangoes grow in wide rage of soils and moisture conditions. A pH range of 5.5-7 is also desirable. Easy access to water may stimulate growth but it discourages flowering. Mangoes thrive well in the tropics. A long season lasting more than three months is needed for fruit production. The best temperature for commercial cultivars is 24˚ - 27˚C. the crop requires rainfall ranging from 750 to 2,500 mm per year. Mangoes, however, are not affected by occasional flooding and are drought tolerant.<br><br><b>Cultural Management</b><br> Propagation. Mango can be propagated by seed, grafting, and budding. Rooting of cuttings and layering are also done but not on a commercial scale. Transplanting. Transplant the seedlings early in the rainy season. The recommended spacing ranges from 10 m that is 100 trees/ha. Irrigation. Irrigate during the first year after transplanting. This provides growth and flushing and suppresses flowering. Irrigation also permits intercropping of fruits (papaya, banana, pineapple) or vegetables during the establishment period. When the trees are big enough to produce a substantial crop, stop irrigation long enough to impose in activity leading to flower initiation. Flowering. Many traditional practices exits to promote mango flowering. Spraying potassium nitrate (KNO³), however, is a simpler and more reliable flower inducing method for the Philippines ‘Carabao’ and ‘Pico’ cultivars. Fertilization. To simulate growth, fertilize with liberal amounts of nitrogen. Also apply fertilizer or manure after harvest to encourage post harvest flush and just before bloom to aid fruit growth. Pruning. Formative pruning is done to shape the trees. Thereafter they are left unpruned until ageing lower limbs need to be removed.<br><br>Annual prining of water sprouts and overlapping branches is recommended.in biennial flowering, prune after harvest, all or some twigs (depending on flowering intensity) which have already flowered. Also prune flowering twigs which do not set fruit. <br><br>Pest and Diseases. Mango joppers and fruit are the most important mango pests in South-East Asia. Anthracnose (Glomerella cingulata, condial stage Colletrotrichum glocosporioides), powdery mildrew, leaf spot, and various storage roots of fruits are the diseases which infect mango. <br><br><b>Harvest and Post harvest Handling</b><br> Pick the fruit manually by climbing the tree. Or use a picking bag with a cutting edge mounted on a bamboo pole. Mature green fruit are ready for harvesting if they have attained full size, the cheeks are well developed, and the endocarp has hardened. In the local market, the mangoes are picked in bamboo baskets lined with protective material. In the export market, mangoes are placed in single layers, preferably in partitioned (into single-fruit) compartments. Export fruit are washed and dipped in fungicide or hot water to control anthracnose. They are shipped by air. To extend the short mango season, fruits can be eaten. They are also ripened artificially with ethylene-releasing carbide. Cool storage can postpone ripening up to one month. Storage conditions depend very much on the cultivar.",

				"name": "VERMICULTURE",
				"description": "<br><br><b>Vermicomposting/Vermiculture</b><br> is an environment-friendly, aerobic and rapid way of composting biodegradable materials/wastes in the farm and households (biodegradable garbage) through the action of hungry, night crawling earthworms to produce an excellent soil enhancer and bioactive organic fertilizer for organic farming and as source of animal protein feed ingredient for poultry, livestock and fish. These organic materials/wastes, like plant residues (dead leaves, twigs, trunks, etc.) animal manure, kitchen and other biodegradable household garbage and farm wastes abound everywhere.<br><br><b>BENEFITS DERIVEDFROM VERMICULTURE</b><br>1. Excellent type of “Organic Fertilizer” is produced<br>2.  High quality “animal protein feed ingredient” is also produced to feed poultry, livestock and fishes.<br>3.  Household biodegradable “dumpsite areas” and the waterways or “aquifers” underneath.<br><br><b>STEPS IN VERMICOMPOSTING/VERMICULTURE</b><br>1. Subject compost substrate/biodegradable materials (dead leaves, freshly-mowed grass, vegetable trimmings/fruit peelings and other plant parts and animal manure) to partial anaerobic decomposition for three weeks by putting them in enclosed conditions – like putting them inside closed sacks or any closed conditions (without air – “anaerobic).<br><br>2. After three weeks inside closed sacks, open the sacks and let the partially-decomposed/pre-fermented substrate materials cool down first before introducing the earthworms (the earthworm stocking rate would be twenty to one hundred adult or juvenile earthworms per sack. The earthworms placed inside the sacks will do the final decomposition process in 60 days.<br><br>3. During the culture process, the sacks are covered with moist rags, old newspapers or coconut palm fronds, to conserve moisture and enhance aeration and placed in a shaded place. Watering the materials is done when necessary (at least three times a week if there is no rain) to have a moist condition for the earthworms.<br><br>4. If drums are to be used for vermicomposting, they should be cut in half and have the sides perforated for aeration. A pail-full of kitchen wastes is first placed at the bottom, followed by a layer of pre-fermented/partially decomposed leaves to prevent flies from breeding in the former. Another layer of kitchen wastes followed by a layer of pre-fermented leaves is added and so on until the drum is filled. One to two hundred earthworms are stocked per drum.<br><br><b>HARVESTING THE VERMICOMPOST/EARTHWORMS</b><br>Harvest of the vermicompost/earthworms is done when most of the materials have been consumed by the worms. This is indicated by the reduction in height of the bed materials from the initial 60 centimeters or so to the final 15-20 centimeters or from 50 kilograms of “partially-decomposed wastes” to 20 kilograms of “vermicompost fertilizer” in 60 days. At this stage, the substrate also has a grainy and loose form compared to the mushy and compact form at the start. The worms at this point have reproduced at least five times and reached their limit of growth with food depletion and waste accumulation.<br><br>For small-scale producers, the manual method of harvesting is usually used. This is done by forming the composed materials into a pyramid pile by hand or using spading fork. After sometime (depending on the volume), when most of the worms have moved to the bottom, the overlying vermicompost can be skimmed off. Final separation of the worms can be done by hand-picking. For large-scale operations, the induced worm transfer method and use of a mechanical sorter are appropriate.<br><br>The “vermicompost fertilizer” produced can be directly applied to the plants which need them or they can be air-dried and stored in bags for future use or can be sold.<br><br><b>SOME IMPORTANT POINTERS ON VERMICOMPOSTING</b><br>“What you put is what you get”  - simply means that whatever composition the “biodegradable materials or substrate materials” you use for vermicomposting is also the composition of your final “vermicompost fertilizer”.<br><br>If you use substrate materials rich in nitrogen, like legumes  plus animal manure, then you would also produce a “vermicompost fertilizer” product also rich in nitrogen ( the usual mixture to produce good quality vermicompost fertilizer is to mix at least 25%  animal manure to 75% of legume and other plant residue materials in your substrate.",

Adventitious roots are also commonly formed at its nodes. Flowers are solitary with lemon yellow to deep orange in color.<br><br><b>Climatic and Soil Requirements</b><br>Squash is a dry-season crop adapted to mean temperatures of 18˚ - 27˚C, but it can also tolerate low temperatures. A relatively dry, warm climate and a dry period is necessary for fruit setting.<br><br>It thrives on many types of soil but grows well on organic-rich medium often found on compost or refuse heaps. A soil PH range of 5.6 to 6.5 is recommended.<br><br><b>Land Preparation</b><br>Squash can be grown with minimum tillage. Clear area and dig holes at appropriate distances. In open areas, a distance of 2-3 m between hills is recommended. Under partial shade or intercropped with coconut, a wider spacing of 4-5 m between hills can be practiced.<br><br>Intensive preparation can also be done by plowing and harrowing twice. Prepare adjacent beds 0.75-1.0 m wide. The double bed where the vines will be trained should be 5-7 m apart.<br><br><b>Planting and Spacing</b><br>Plant either by direct sowing to plots or containers, or transplanting. In direct seeding, drill 2-3 seeds/hill at a depth 2-3 cm with a distance of 2-3m between rows an d 1m between hills. In backyard gardens, squash can be grown with trellises to maximize space.<br><br>Incorporate decomposed animal manure and other compost materials to the soil to improve soil structure. Apply mulch to minimize weeds and also maintain adequate soil moisture. Rice straw, grass clippings and  plastic can be used as mulching materials.<br><br><b>Irrigation</b><br>Squash is tolerant to drought but it benefits well from regular irrigation during dry season. Irrigate by furrow every 7-10 days. Mulching can help conserved soil moisture. The double bed method can make furrow irrigation easier and more systematic.<br><br><b>Fertilization</b><br>At planting, apply 1-2 kg per hill of well-decomposed manure or compost. Apply complete fertilizer (14-14-14) at 20-30 g/hill. Side-dress with 10-20 g of 1:1 mixture of urea (46-0-0) and muriate of potash (0-0-60) every 2-4 weeks depending on plant growth. Use lower rates of urea if the plants are too vigorous. Wood ash and rice hull ash can also be used as source of potassium.<br><br><b>Pest and Disease Management</b><br>Squash is susceptible to cucurbit beetle and cutworms. To control, spread wood ash or rice hull ash on leaves. Another major pest is fruit fly.<br><br>The common disease of squash are bacterial wilt, downy mildew, powdery mildew, little leaf, squash leaf curl and water melon mosaic virus. Bacterial wilt can be minimized through the use of compost and animal manure. The mildews and viruses are best controlled by using resistant or tolerant varieties such as Rizalina, and through strict sanitation.<br><br><b>Harvesting</b><br>Harvest just before fruits are fully ripe or when the peduncle starts to dry up. It is best to harvest the fruits with a portion of the peduncle attached to prolong storage life. Squash is also harvested immature when it is to be cooked with the skin intact. Avoid cutting fruits from the vines if it cannot be marketed immediately.",

Rainfall should be well distributed throughout the year. Mangosteen can thrive at an elevation of up to some 1,500 m.<br><br><b>Cultural Management</b><br><b>Propagation.</b> Mangosteen is mostly propagated by seed. Attempts to use other methods of propagation like cutting, grafting, or budding failed. Grafting is not difficult but results in slower growth. The fruit also tends to be small. However, inarching proved to be a better alternative.<br><br>Sow seeds in nursery beds. Cover them a colored plastic sheet, or place them under shade. Apply animal manure or foliar fertilizer to improve growth.<br><br><b>Planting.</b>Seedlings 25-30 cm tall or about two years old may be transplanted in the field. Prepare the field thoroughly. Set the stakes 8-10 m apart, and dig holes at position occupied by stakes. Prune the leaves.<br><br>Then, carefully remove the seedlings from their containers to avoid distributing the root system before placing them in the holes. Fill the holes with top soil or compost. Out planting must be done at the onset of the rainy season.<br><br>Shade must be maintained for two to four years and then gradually reduced. Weed regularly, or put heavy mulch around the plants.<br><br><b>Irrigation.</b>Mangosteen requires adequate and an uninterrupted water supply. If rainfall is not evenly distributed throughout the year, the use of an irrigation system can supply the needed amount.<br><br>The seedlings does not have an efficient root system. It is therefore m very important to keep the soil moisture at a high level, especially at the initial grown stage.<br><br><b>Fertilization.</b> Like any fruit-bearing tree, the mangosteen also needs nutrients. These may be provided by organic (compost) as well as inorganic (urea, complete fertilizer) materials.<br><br>Experts advise the application of 50-100 g ammonium sulfate a month after planting, at the end of the rainy season, and after six months. When plants start bearing fruits, apply 500 g complete fertilizer at the start of the rainy season and every six months thereafter. Yearly application of at least 2 kg complete fertilizer per full grown tree is recommended.<br><br><b>Pests and disease.</b> Caterpillars feed on the young leaves. Sucking insects can cause fruit drop. Among the fungal diseases identified, the red (Phellinus noxuis) and brown (Ganoderma pseudoferreum) root rots are sometimes serious. No control measures are however, known.<br><br>Gamboge, the yellow exudates from the bark, frequently spoils fruits. The white pulp turns translucent and becomes bitter as gamboge penerates this segment. Gamboge is often found as yellow spots in the fruit skin.<br><br>Damage to the latex vessels causes gamboges. This may be due to over watching after drought, punctures of sucking insects (capsids), strong wind, rough harvesting and handling. <br><br><b>Harvesting and Post harvest Handling</b><br>Fruits usually ripen over a period o 6-12 weeks. Top-quality mangosteen fruit is obtained by picking all fruits which have turned light red in color every two to three days.<br><br>Harvesters climb the tree to pick the fruit. They also use bamboo poles with a V-shape cut at the top to get the fruit. Harvested light red fruits ripen in five days, turning dark purple in color.<br><br>Despite its thick wall which hardens at the ripening stage, the fruit remains prone to damages. For instance, a fall of 20 cm can damage a freshly picked fruit. Thus, the fruits must be handled with care.<br><br>The fruit is often graded by size. Gamboge spots are also removed.
